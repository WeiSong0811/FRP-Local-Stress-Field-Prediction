# FRP-Local-Stress-Field-Prediction
Machine learning based prediction of local stress field in fiber reinforced polymers

Rapid analyses of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) continuously gain importance in the context of lightweight design. 

Given the pronounced microscopic heterogeneity of FRP, identical macroscopic loading conditions can lead to significantly different local stress fields and thus be potentially detrimental to the structural integrity.

Currently, the prediction of the local stress field in FRP is computationally expensive and requires the use of non-linear high-fidelity models, such as finite element analysis (FEA).

In this work, the transferability of an approach recently proposed by Raabe and his team for the prediction of the local stress field in polycrystalline materials to FRP shall be investigated: fundamental approach, application to non-linear material behavior.

The approach is based on the training of a machine learning model on a dataset of local stress fields obtained from high-fidelity simulations of a set of representative volume elements (RVEs) with varying microstructures and loading conditions.

The model is subsequently used to predict the local stress field in unseen samples based on their microstructure and the macroscopic deformation state.

A possible workflow for this project could be as follows:
Review of the literature on the prediction of local stress fields in FRP and the transferability of machine learning models between different materials.
Generation of a dataset of local stress fields in FRP RVEs with varying microstructures and loading conditions using FEA.
Implementation of a machine learning pipeline for the prediction of local stress fields based on the dataset.
Evaluation of the predictive performance of different machine learning models on unseen samples.
Documentation of the results and comparison with existing approaches.
The successful completion of this project could provide a computationally efficient method for the prediction of local stress fields in FRP, enabling rapid analyses of complex structures and contributing to the advancement of lightweight design in engineering applications.
